# RasberryPie-Project
#RFID Attendance System
The goal of this project is to create a real-time attendance monitoring system by utilising Android Studio, Firebase, MySQL, Raspberry Pi, and VNC Viewer capabilities. There are three sides to it:
1. The first one is an RFID tag-based Raspberry Pi device that staff members will use to record their attendance.

2. The administrator will utilise an Android application built on Kotlin to monitor his staff members' attendance in real time.

3. The Parse backend application will be used to connect these two sides.
